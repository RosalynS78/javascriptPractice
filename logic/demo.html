<!-- good habit to put script at bottom of body -->
<!-- It's not the ideal place to put a JavaScript script -->
<!-- that way the page loads first so that the user can see the full website at first glance. This is why some websites display the header first, and then everything else pops up later, for example. Some pages take time loading up the scripts -->
