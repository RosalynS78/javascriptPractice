# Increment Operator

i++ vs ++i

## i++

###### **1) Post-Increment (fixed) (i++):**  **we use i++ in our statement if we want to use the current value, and then we want to increment the value of i by 1** **.**

ex.

let i = 0

i++ = 0

i = 1 //Returns number one.

i++ expression was executed but it returned the value prior to the increment and then it updated the i variable after that returns 1

ex.

let i = 5

let result = i++

result = 5

i = 6

## ++i

###### 2) Pre-Increment(++i): We use ++i in our statement if we want to increment the value of i by 1 and then use it in our statement.

ex. 

let i = 0

++1 = 1//returned the number 1 returned the new incremented value 

i = 1

ex.

let i = 5

let result = ++i

result = 6

i = 6

##### when to use

1) **Post-Increment (i++): we use i++ in our statement if we want to use the current value, and then we want to increment the value of i by 1 .**
2) **Pre-Increment(++i): We use ++i in our statement if we want to increment the value of i by 1 and then use it in our statement.**
