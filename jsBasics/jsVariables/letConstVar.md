# Let

let allows us to make a variable that we can reassign

make variables using let

let (identifer) = (value);

two other keywords to make variables

# Const

const stands for constant

*constant is a value that does not change*

-works just like let except you CANNOT change the value

ex.

const hens = 4;

hens = 20; //error

const age = 17;

age = age + 1; //error

ex.

const luckyNum = 26;

luckyNum = 26 // cannot increment it or change it or reassign it

## why use const 

store value that we know won't change (situations where const makes sense over let (Arrays and Objects))

ex.

const pi = 3.14150;

const daysInWeek = 7;

const minHeightForRide = 60;

const feetInMile = 5280;

# Var

**the old variable keyword**

Before let and const, var was the only way of declaring variables.  These days there isn't really a reaso. to use it (still works just not used)

ex.

var runDistance = 26.2;

runDistance = 26.2

runDistance =+;

27.2


*let and const the newer ways to make variables and should be used exclusively - there is no reason to use var (ever)*
