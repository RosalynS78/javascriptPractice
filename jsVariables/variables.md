# Variables

#### Variables are like Labels for Values

-We can store a value and give it a name so that we can:

*  *Refer back to it later

* *Use that value to do ...stuff
* *Or change it later one

## Basic Syntax

let someName = value;

ex. 

(how to read -  make a variable called "year" and give it the value of 1985)

let year = 1985;

### Recall Values

ex.

let hens = 4;

let roosters = 2;

hens + roosters //6

ex.

(two variables numHens and Num Roosters / 5 and 1)

let numHens = 5;

let numRoosters = 1;

(name + name = finds values 5 & 1)

numHens + numRoosters = 6

ex.

(retrieving the value onf numHens and adding 1)

(add 1 to numHens)

numHens + 1 = 6

ex. 

let totalChickens = numHens +numRoosters;

totalChickens

//6

to change values of numHens

numHens = 6 

or

numHens = numHens + 1;

(new value)

//7
