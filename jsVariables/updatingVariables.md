# Updating Variables

ex.

let score = 0;

(one way but only works once)

score = 5;

//5

(take the current value and add 5)

score = score + 5;

score = 10

##### more common and shorter syntax

(take current score, set it equal to score plus 5)

score +=5;

another ex.

score = score - 50;

(shorter syntax)

(take score, set it equal to score minus 50)

score -=50;

### *more common to increment or decrement by 1*

let numLives = 9;

(subtract 1)

numLives -= 1;

(add 1)

numLives +=1;

### shorter option

(decrement to the left (minus numLives))

numLives--;

(increment to the left (add numLives))

numLive++;
